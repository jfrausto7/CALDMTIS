# CALDMTIS (Comparative Analysis of Latent Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Synthesis)
This research-oriented repository aims to conduct a practical evaluation of diverse latent diffusion models in generating images from text prompts. By employing CLIP, Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE), Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE), Tenengrad (TENG), and Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD) scores I analyze and compare image quality, composition, and alignment with textual input. These scores collectively establish a rigorous framework to objectively assess image quality, semantic alignment, and visual composition in the context of text-to-image generation.
